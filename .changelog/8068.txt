```release-note:breaking-change
connect: Consul Service Identity ACL tokens automatically generated for Connect services are now
created as Local rather than Global tokens. Nomad clusters with Connect services making cross-Consul
datacenter requests will need to ensure their Consul agents are configured with anonymous ACL tokens
of sufficient permissions.
```
